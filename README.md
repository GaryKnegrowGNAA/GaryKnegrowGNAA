# Hello, I am Gary Knegrow, President and CEO of the [GNAA](https://gnaa.world).

___
I am an experienced backend and frontend programmer and developer. I am fluent in many languages, including C, C++, Rust, HolyC, Go, Ruby, Lua, Python, JS, TS, Malbolge, Lolcode, and Afrikaans.


Being an expert programmer, I am the leading figurehead and mastermind behind the GNAA. I believe in a unitary, solidified gay black race. Join me in my road for total gay sexual liberation.
